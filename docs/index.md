# Welcome to my learning journal
My name is Ilias Takassa, and I am a final-year student in HBO-ICT with a specialization in Cyber Security at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. With a strong interest in penetration testing, I am passionate about discovering vulnerabilities in systems and enhancing digital security.

On this website, you will find a collection of my projects and knowledge within the field of penetration testing. There are Capture the Flag walkthroughs available that I have completed on Hack The Box and TryHackMe. Additionally, there is a cheat sheet that assists me in conducting penetration tests. This cheat sheet includes handy one-liners, scripts, and more.

You can follow me on my LinkedIn and GitHub pages, which can be found here below.

Thank you for your visit, and enjoy exploring my website!
